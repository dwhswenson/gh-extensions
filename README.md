# gh-extensions

*Custom local extensions for the GitHub CLI*

These are just a couple tools I use for myself. [GitHub instructions on
interpreted extensions
here](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/creating-github-cli-extensions#creating-an-interpreted-extension-manually)

To install, switch into the directory of each extension you're interested in,
and use the command `gh extensions install .`.
